I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry with excellent grades from top universities in Pakistan. I am currently employed as a chemistry lecturer at the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS), a top-ranked public university in Pakistan. My professional focus revolves around teaching, conducting research, continuous learning, and effectively communicating my findings with peers and colleagues. I believe in the philosophy of converting ideas into reality, and in pursuance, I have published a total of five research articles in reputed Q1 journals, particularly focused on nanomaterials, polymers, and polymer nanocomposites for various applications, including optoelectronics, EMI shielding, energy storage, energy conservation, and biomedical applications. In addition to these peer-reviewed articles, I have co-supervised eight MS theses in diverse fields, including organic synthesis, catalysis, adsorption, and electrochemistry. Further, I also have a strong background in Python programming, specifically in machine learning, modeling, and data analysis.

Research Highlights

## 1. Preparation and investigation of Montmorillonite-K10 Polyaniline nanocomposites for optoelectronic applications
One-dimensional polyaniline (PANI) nanostructures were synthesized in situ in the presence of two-dimensional (2D) Montmorillonite (MMT) clay nanosheets. Strong interactions between the polymer and MMT platelets in the nanocomposites were confirmed through spectroscopic studies. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopic studies revealed the clay’s profound effect on the polymer’s crystallinity and morphology. The clay nanosheets induced higher crystallinity and well-defined nanorod morphology in the polymer structure. Consequently, the nanocomposite showed an electrical conductivity of 8.72 S/cm, closer to that of the pristine polymer (8.97 S/cm), 
despite the presence of highly insulting clay material. Surprisingly, a notable decrease in the optical bandgap of the polymer from 3.73 to 2.88 eV of the nanocomposite was also observed. This novel integration of a narrow band gap and high conductivity in PANI/MMT nanocomposites can expand their utility for visible light interactions in areas encompassing photocatalysis, photovoltaics, electro/photochromism, and related technologies.

## 2. Silver Nanoplates Polyimide Nanocomposites for EMI Shielding Applications
Two-dimensional (2D) silver nanoplates are chemically synthesized in the presence of guar gum – a naturally occurring biopolymer. The polymer directs anisotropic growth of silver nuclei into high aspect ratio nanoplates spanning 4500 ± 500 nm lateral length with thickness as small as 40 ± 10 nm. After a thorough investigation of the reaction parameters (temperature, precursor to reductant ratio, and polymer quantity) on the morphology of the product, a scalable synthetic protocol to achieve good yields (95%–98%) of highly pure (~100%) 2D silver nanoplates (AgNPls) in a facile, inexpensive, room temperature, aqueous phase chemical reaction of only about 5 min is devised. The optimized AgNPls induce appreciable conductivity of 5.5 ± 0.38 S/cm in polyimide at only 12 wt% loading. Consequently, the resulting polymer nanocomposite (containing 12 wt% AgNPls), at only 130 ± 15 μm thickness and 0.45 g/cm3 density, effectively blocks electromagnetic radiation in X-band with a total shield effectiveness of about 10 dB resulting in substantially high specific shielding effectiveness and absolute shielding effectiveness of 22.48 and 1729.23 dB cm3 g−1, respectively. Additionally, the nanocomposites remain thermally stable up to 500°C in oxidative environment and possess an appreciably high storage modulus of 3.113 GPa at 50°C. These low-density conductive polyimide films, therefore, present great prospects in shielding against electromagnetic interference under extreme conditions.

## 3. Scalable synthesis of high-quality, reduced graphene oxide with a large C/O ratio and its dispersion in a chemically modified polyimide matrix for electromagnetic interference shielding applications
High-purity reduced graphene oxide (RGO or rGO) with appreciable conductivity is a desired conductive filler for lightweight polymer composites used in coatings, electronics, catalysts, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, and energy storage devices. However, the intrinsic conductivity and the uniform dispersion of RGO in relatively polar matrices are challenging, leading to poor overall conductivity and performance of the composite material. The reported study improved the RGO intrinsic conductivity by increasing its C/O ratio while also simultaneously enhancing its compatibility with the polyimide (PI) matrix through ester linkages for better dispersion. A two-step reduction method drastically increased the number of structural defects and carbon content in the resulting RGO, corresponding to a maximum ID/IG and C/O of 1.54 and ∼87, respectively. Moreover, the 2D nanosheets with limited hydroxyl (–OH) groups effectively interacted with anhydride-terminated polyamic acid (AT-PAA) through chemical linkages to make high-performance RGO/PI nanocomposites. Consequently, the polymer matrix composites possessed the highest direct current conductivity of 15.27 ± 0.61 S cm−1 for 20 wt% of the prepared RGO. Additionally, the composite material was highly stiff (3.945 GPa) yet flexible (easily bent through 180°), lightweight (∼0.34 g cm−3), and capable of forming thin films (162 ± 15 μm). Unlike most polymer matrix composites, it showcased one of its class's highest thermal stabilities (a weight loss of only 5% at 638 °C). Ultimately, the composite performed as an effective electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material in the X-Band (8 to 12 GHz), demonstrating outstanding shielding effectiveness (SE), shielding effectiveness per unit thickness (SEt), specific shielding effectiveness (SSE), and absolute shielding effectiveness (SSEt) of 46 dB, 2778 dB cm−2, 138 dB cm3 g−1, and 8358 dB cm2 g−1, respectively. As a consequence of this research, the high-purity RGO and its high-performance PI matrix nanocomposites are anticipated to find practical applications in conductive coatings and flexible substrates demanding high-temperature stability.

## 4. Preparation of additive free tungsten trioxide thin films using spin-coating method for electrochrochemical applications
Tungsten trioxide (WO3) is a well-known electroactive substance that stores electrochemical energy and changes color reversibly due to redox events triggered by a certain voltage and has a wide range of uses. In this research work, thin films of WO3 were prepared using spin-coating of additive free WO3 sols. The sols were prepared from tungstic acid precursor, purified through ion-exchange method, under hydrothermal conditions. Particle size of the suspensions and phase of the thin films prepared from suspensions, were evaluated using laser particle analyzer and XRD, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry was used to conduct electrochemical behavior of the synthesized material. Thin films obtained under hydrothermal temperature of 120 ℃ possessed the optimum particle size distribution centered around 80 nm, optimum crystallite size and superior electrochemical performance.

## 5. Development of a Ce-doped hydroxyapatite–sodium alginate biocomposite for bone and dental implants
Biomaterials must be biocompatible and provide excellent mechanical strength when used as bone and dental implants. To enhance the physical, mechanical and biological properties, a unique cerium-doped hydroxyapatite–sodium alginate (Ce–HAp–SA) biocomposite was synthesized using the wet precipitation method. The XRD patterns of the pristine and doped samples matched well with hydroxyapatite (HAp) and the appearance of characteristic peaks of HAp in the FTIR spectra confirmed the successful synthesis of HAp and Ce–HA–SA. The SEM micrographs clearly showed the presence of pores in the doped samples, while a density of 3.0 g cm−3 was obtained. The maximum microhardness of 27.5 GPa was achieved in the 2 wt% Ce-doped sample. The anti-bacterial activity of the HAp–SA composite increases as the Ce concentration increases. A 37 day ion release test in simulated body fluid (SBF) verified that no Ce ions leached under physiological conditions. The results showed that the Ce–HAp–SA composite could be a promising material for bone and teeth implants, because of its excellent physical, mechanical and biological properties.
