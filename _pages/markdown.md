My teaching philosophy, deeply influenced by Tina L. Overtonâ€™s insightful article *"Teaching Chemists to Think: From Parrots to Professionals,"* centers on nurturing critical thinking over rote memorization. I am committed to designing my classes in a way that fosters creativity and equips students with the skills needed to excel as professionals in chemistry. By prioritizing a deep understanding of core concepts, my aim is to transform students from passive learners into curious and analytical thinkers who approach problems with confidence and insight.
